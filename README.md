Place for my code and notes from this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-for-java-developers/

## Kotlin notes
* Kotlin variables are statically typed.
* Kotlin uses compile-time type inference. Types are determined by the context in which the variables are used.
* Keyword 'val' is equivalent of a Java 'final' variable, and 'var' is a non-final variable.

## Kotlin reference material
